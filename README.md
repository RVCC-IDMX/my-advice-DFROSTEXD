# My Advice

This repo gives you a fully configured professional tooling setup. Your job is to use an AI agent conversation to plan and build your personal "What Should I...?" site inside it.

The tooling is already here — linting, formatting, pre-commit hooks, CI, and a dev server. You bring the site.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

After `npm install`, Husky sets up pre-commit hooks automatically. Running `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server — you should see a placeholder page in the browser.

## Local development

This project uses the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to fetch live movie data. You need an API key to run it locally:

1. Get a free API key at [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root
3. Add your key: `TMDB_API_KEY=your-key-here`

**For the deployed site:** The same `TMDB_API_KEY` environment variable must be set in Netlify under Site configuration → Environment variables. Without it, the serverless function will return a 500 error.

## Learning objectives

- Set up and work inside a professional JavaScript tooling harness
- Understand what linting and formatting do and why teams use them
- Experience pre-commit quality gates that catch problems before they reach GitHub
- Read and understand a CI workflow with GitHub Actions
- Use an AI agent conversation to plan and generate a complete site from a build prompt

## Where your site lives

The `src/` folder is where your generated site's code will go. Your AI agent conversation will create files like `src/js/data.js`, `src/js/matching.js`, and `src/js/app.js`, plus `src/css/style.css` for your styles.

A placeholder `index.html` is included so the project builds and runs from the start. Your AI agent conversation will replace it with your real site.
